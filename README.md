# Project Title

DIYFOOD: Culinary recommendation application tailored for tourists visiting Jogja, allowing them to discover and enjoy authentic Jogja cuisines easily.

# Executive Summary/Abstract:
Our team is dedicated to developing a culinary recommendation application specifically designed for the Jogja region, featuring a user-friendly interface that reflects the rich cultural heritage of Jogja. This application will allow users to explore and discover authentic Jogja cuisine with ease. The main features of the application include user login, a step-by-step selection process for culinary categories, data processing to generate personalized recommendations, and detailed information about each recommendation along with a list of restaurants or places where users can find them.

Our motivation for embarking on this project stems from the growing demand among both local and international tourists visiting Jogja, who are eager to experience the authentic and diverse culinary offerings of the region. We believe that by providing a convenient platform for tourists to explore and indulge in Jogja's culinary delights, we can enhance their overall experience and satisfaction during their visit.

Moreover, we see this application as an opportunity to promote and preserve Jogja's culinary heritage. By showcasing the richness and uniqueness of Jogja cuisine to a wider audience, we aim to contribute to its continued appreciation and recognition both locally and globally. Through this initiative, we hope to foster a deeper connection between tourists and the local culinary scene, encouraging them to explore beyond the typical tourist attractions and immerse themselves in the authentic flavors of Jogja.

In summary, our culinary recommendation application aims to not only meet the needs of tourists but also to celebrate and preserve the culinary heritage of Jogja for future generations to enjoy.
